# Ship Swarm Shoot-Up

This is a fairly simple arcade-style space shooter in the style of the early '80's but with original game play (specifically ai mechanics) and assets.  The game binaries are available at:
https://jaredbgreat.itch.io/ship-swarm-shoot-up

It is an original and straight-forward game, and is complete at this time.  It is based on my own simple arcade framework, KnightFerret Engine 0 (zero), found here:
